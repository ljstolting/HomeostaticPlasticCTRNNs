In general, the workflow consisted of collecting data samples with C++ code, compiled using a Makefile on a Mac machine, and visualizing that data using a combination of Mathematica and Jupyter Notebooks. Bifurcation analysis was also done using Randall Beer's Dynamica package in Mathematica. Files sufficient to replicate each section of the paper are partitioned into folders, including some repeat files that are necessary for all the sections but unchanged between them. This is for ease of compilation using this method. I'm always happy to discuss replications or extensions of this project!
